====================
django-roa changelog
====================

Version 0.5, 27 December 2008:
------------------------------

* Backward incompatible change: Remote* classes had been renamed to ROA*, this
  is an internal change which should not affect your code.
* Add support for ROA_URL_OVERRIDES_* settings and a complete example.
* Declaration of default manager is no more required, if you inherit from
  django_roa.Model it will be added automatically given your ROA_MODELS
  setting.
* Use the latest version of restclient (0.2.1), no more httplib2 dependency.
  This version uses pycurl, urllib2 or httplib2 given your configuration, in
  this order of preferences.


Version 0.4, 27 December 2008:
------------------------------

* Backward incompatible change: resource_url_list is no more defined in Meta 
  class, now you must define your own get_resource_url_list static method in
  your Model class. resource_url_detail has been renamed as 
  get_resource_url_detail for consistency and is no more a property.
* Add support for ForeignKeys and XML serialization.
* Bugfixes: DateTimeField and BooleanField should work as expected.
* Add a complete example with a custom slug for multiple primary keys.
* Ease debugging with a summary displayed if you use the test server instead
  of the whole HTML error.


Version 0.3, 23 December 2008:
------------------------------

* Backward incompatible change: resource_url_id is no more defined in Meta 
  class, now you can define your own resource_url_detail property in your
  Model class. resource_url Meta attribute has been renamed as 
  resource_url_list for consistency.
* Bugfixes: RemoteQuerySet.count() and BooleanField should work as expected.
* Better documentation, still need improvements.
