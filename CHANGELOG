django-roa changelog
====================

Version 0.4, 27 December 2008:
------------------------------

* Backward incompatible change: resource_url_list is no more defined in Meta 
  class, now you must define your own get_resource_url_list static method in
  your Model class. resource_url_detail has been renamed as 
  get_resource_url_detail for consistency and is no more a property.
* Add support for ForeignKeys and XML serialization.
* Bugfixes: DateTimeField and BooleanField should work as expected.
* Add a complete example with a custom slug for multiple primary keys.
* Ease debugging with a summary displayed if you use the test server instead
  of the whole HTML error.


Version 0.3, 23 December 2008:
------------------------------

* Backward incompatible change: resource_url_id is no more defined in Meta 
  class, now you can define your own resource_url_detail property in your
  Model class. resource_url Meta attribute has been renamed as 
  resource_url_list for consistency.
* Bugfixes: RemoteQuerySet.count() and BooleanField works as expected.
* Better documentation, still need improvements.
